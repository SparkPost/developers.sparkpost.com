Use the options.start_time attribute to delay generation of messages. The scheduled time must be in the future and cannot be greater than 1 year from the time of submission. If the scheduled time does not fall in that range, the transmission is not accepted. For more information see [_Schedule Transmissions_](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/#/reference/transmissions).
