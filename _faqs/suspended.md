Please [submit a support request](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/emails/new?email[subject]=Why%20Have%20I%20Been%20Suspended?) to get more information.

If you're transitioning to SparkPost from another Email Service Provider, one possible cause for your account getting suspended is that your previous provider built a suppression list out of your bounces and FBL complaints. When you switch over to us, that list doesn't come with you automagically. You'll need to either remove those suppressions from your current lists, or copy the suppression list from Mandrill and upload it to SparkPost. Otherwise you'll be automatically sending to everyone who had bounced or complained over the years, which is likely to cause your account to be suspended.
