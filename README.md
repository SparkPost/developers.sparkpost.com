# developers.sparkpost.com

This repo contains the code and documentation that powers [developers.sparkpost.com](https://developers.sparkpost.com).

## Get started

### Requirements

To develop with this repository, you must have the following:

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): version 14.16.1
2. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/troubleshooting/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm): version 7 recommended (version 6 is incompatible with the current lock file)
3. A [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) of this repo

### Installing dependencies

1. `cd developers.sparkpost.com` to go into the website directory
1. Run `npm run bootstrap` to install the npm dependencies

### Local development

When developing locally, you have two options: developing the whole website or develop _just_ the API reference section. All content will hot-reload. If you aren't seeing changes, restart the development server.

#### Develop the website

This will develop the whole developer site.

1. Run `npm run develop`
1. Open [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to view the website.

#### Develop API reference

**This is what you want if you are making documentation changes.**

This will only develop the API reference pages and skip unnecessary queries.

1. Run `npm run docs`
2. Open [http://localhost:4000/api/](http://localhost:4000/api/) to view the docs.

#### Develop Netlify Lambda Functions

To develop [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) locally, run `npm run lambda`. This will start a second development server for the serverless functions.

Each file located in the `lambda/` directory will be deployed as a serverless function.

## Contributing

You'll find the all the content, pages, and data inside the `content` folder. If you are contributing content, take a
few minutes and read through the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Create a branch

Create a branch for your work in the repo:

1. `git checkout main` to checkout the main branch
1. `git pull origin main` to get the lastest code
1. `git checkout -b your-branch-name` to create a branch

### Make your changes

1. Follow the [Local development](#local-development) instructions to start the development server
1. Make your changes as needed
1. Changes to any files in the `content` and `src` directories will [hot-reload](https://code-cartoons.com/hot-reloading-and-time-travel-debugging-what-are-they-3c8ed2812f35).
1. If you make changes files in the `plugins` and `gatsby` directories or any top-level files, you will need to restart the server.

### Push your changes

1. Stage and commit your changes (`git add -A && git commit -m "Describe what you did"`)
1. Push your changes (`git push origin your-branch-name`)
1. [Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) against the `main` branch. Netlify will publish a [deploy preview](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) so you can share and preview your changes as a live site.

## Troubleshooting

### Python related issues

#### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'` during npm run bootstrap
1. distutils package is removed in Python version 3.12
2. Create a virtual environment (venv) and `pip install setuptools`
3. _or_ use a Python version 3.11 or earlier

### M1 Pro related issues

#### `fatal error: 'vips/vips8' file not found:` during npm run bootstrap
1. You have to install "libvps" globally on your mac system to get this plugin to work on your development machine.
You need brew installed to do this.
2. The "libvps" depends on gcc, so do:
3. ```brew install --build-from-source gcc```
4. ```brew install vips```
5. Proceed with ```npm run boostrap``` again


#### `FATAL ERROR: wasm code commit Allocation failed - process out of memory` during npm run docs
1. Install `node v.16.14.0` (you can use [nodenv or node-build](https://github.com/nodenv/node-build) for that)
2. Proceed with `npm run docs` again
