## 1. Typographical Conventions Used in This Document
Certain typographical conventions are used in this document. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following examples.
*   **Text in this style**               indicates executable programs such as **ecelerity**.
*   `Text in this style` is used when referring to file names. For example, "The `ecelerity.conf` file is used to configure Momentum."
*   `Text in this style` is used when referring to command options. For example, "`list` is an option for the **module** command."
*   *Text in this style*               is used for emphasis.
*   **Text in this style**               is used for added emphasis.
*   *`Text in this style`*                indicates variable input—text that changes depending upon circumstances. For example, "For *`passwd`* enter the password you created during installation."
*   **`Text in this style`**                indicates user input. For example, "Install the application by issuing the command **`./installer`**."
*   `Text in this style` is used for literal values and variable names. For example, "A license file named `license`."
*   Text such as the following, ‘`C`’, is used to indicate a literal reference to a specific character. For example, "The letter ‘`C`’ in CIDR stands for 'Classless'".
In some circumstances, what appears on one line on the screen or in a program listing cannot be represented on one line in some forms of the documentation. In circumstances such as this, the ‘`»`’ character is used. For example:
```
1398088802 10.77.0.158:18906 *:2081 "POST /transmissions?org_id=1&num_rcpt_errors=0 »
  HTTP/1.0" 500 332 1045.000
```
The preceding line would appear unbroken in a log file but, if left as is, it would be truncated in a PDF version of the documentation.
Where possible, Unix command-line commands are broken using the ‘`\`’ character, making it possible to copy and paste commands. For example:
/opt/msys/ecelerity/bin/eccfg bootstrap --clustername *`name`* --username=admin \
    --password=*`admin cluster_host`*
