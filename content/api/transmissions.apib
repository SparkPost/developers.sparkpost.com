description: Use the transmissions API to send a batch of messages through SparkPost.

# Group Transmissions

The Transmissions endpoint lets you send email. Each transmission can send an email to a single recipient or thousands. SparkPost generates and sends messages using the options you've defined, a list of recipients, and the content given in transmissions call.

When creating a transmission, the [options](#header-request-body) allow you to configure engagement tracking, sending optimization, global substitution data, and more to control how your emails are sent.

To set the recipients you can include the all recipients in the request or use a [stored recipient list](/api/recipient-lists/). In each recipient, you can pass in metadata and substitution data to [personalize](/api/substitutions-reference/) each email. You can also set the transmission to treat certain recipients as [CC'd or BCC'd](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/faq/cc-bcc-with-rest-api/).

The content of the messages can be set in 4 different ways: [inline content](#transmissions-post-send-inline-content), a [stored template](#transmissions-post-send-a-template), an [A/B test](#transmissions-post-send-an-a-b-test), or raw [RFC822 content](#transmissions-post-send-rfc822-content). Each method has different use cases they are best suited for. All of these types of content can use the substitution data and metadata to create a unique message for each recipient.

Learn about [how to optimize your sending](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/tech-resources/smtp-rest-api-performance/) with SparkPost.

### The Sandbox Domain

The sandbox domain allows you to send your first email without setting up a sending domain. You can send up to 5 sandbox messages over the lifetime of your account. To send a message from the sandbox domain, set the `from` address to `anything@sparkpostbox.com` and set `options.sandbox` to `true`. Just like with any sending domain, you can set the part before the `@` to any mailbox.

For more extensive testing with your own sending doman, use the SparkPost [Sink Server](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/faq/using-sink-server/).

<Banner status="info">The sandbox domain is not available for <strong><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/enterprise-email/">Enterprise</a></strong> accounts.</Banner>


### Sending Limits

Your account has a sandbox, hourly, daily, and monthly sending limit based on your current plan level. You can view your current limits on your [dashboard](https://app.sparkpost.com/dashboard) ([EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/dashboard)). If a transmission will push you over the sandbox, hourly, or daily sending limit, an error with the status code `420` is returned, along with a message detailing which limit you will exceed. If this happens, no messages are sent, regardless of the number of messages in the transmission that will push you passed your limit.

Learn more about these [limits](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/faq/daily-and-monthly-quota-limits/) and [what counts towards usage](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/what-counts-daily-monthly-usage/).

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Exceed Sending Limit (hourly)",
      "code": "2101"
    }
  ]
}
```


## Create a Transmission [/transmissions/{?num_rcpt_errors}]

You can create a transmission in a number of ways. In all cases, you can use the `num_rcpt_errors` parameter to limit the number of recipient errors returned.

### Send Inline Content [POST]

Substitution syntax is supported in `from`, `subject`, `text`, `html`, `reply_to`, and `headers`. The following attributes are used when specifying inline content in the transmission's `content` object:

+ Data Structure: Content Attributes
    + from (enum, required) - Email address used to compose the email's `From` header. The domain must be a verified sending domain. Can be a string with a valid email address or an object with the following attributes:
        + (string)
        + (object)
            + name (string) - The name associated with the email address.
            + email (string, required) - The email address to send from.
    + subject (string, required) - Email subject line. Expected in the UTF-8 charset without RFC2047 encoding.
    + html (string) - HTML content for the email's `text/html` MIME part. At a minimum, html or text is required. Expected in the UTF-8 charset with no `Content-Transfer-Encoding` applied.
    + text (string) - Text content for the email's `text/plain` MIME part. At a minimum, html or text is required. Expected in the UTF-8 charset with no `Content-Transfer-Encoding` applied.
    + reply_to (string) - Email address used to compose the email's "Reply-To" header.
    + headers (object) - Object containing headers other than `Subject`, `From`, `To`, and `Reply-To` . See the [Header Notes](#header-header-notes).
    + attachments (array[object]) - Array of attachments. For a full description, see [Attachment Object](#header-attachment-object).
    + inline_images (array[object]) - Array of inline images For a full description, see [Inline Image Object](#header-inline-image-object).

#### Header Notes

* Headers such as `Content-Type` and `Content-Transfer-Encoding` are not allowed, as they are auto-generated upon construction of the email.
* The `To` header should not be specified, since it is generated from each recipient's `address` field.
* Each header value is expected in the UTF-8 charset without RFC2047 encoding.
* Substitution syntax is supported in headers.

#### Attachment Object

Attachments for a transmission are specified in the `content.attachments` array where each object in the array is described by the following attributes:

+ Data Structure: Attributes
    + name (string, required) - The filename of the attachment. This is inserted into the filename parameter of the `Content-Disposition` header. Maximum length - 255 bytes
    + type (string, required) - The MIME type of the attachment. The value will apply as-is to the `Content-Type` header of the generated MIME part for the attachment. <br /> Include the `charset` parameter, if needed (e.g. `text/html; charset="UTF-8"`)
    + data (string, required) - The content of the attachment as a Base64 encoded string. The string should not contain `\r\n` line breaks. SparkPost will add line breaks as necessary to ensure the Base64 encoded lines contain no more than 76 characters each.
+ Sample
    ```
    {
        "name": "billing.pdf",
        "type": "application/pdf",
        "data": "Q29uZ3JhdHVsYXRpb25zLCB5b3UgY2FuIGJhc2U2NCBkZWNvZGUh"
    }
    ```

<Banner status="danger">Sending attachments with malicious content is <strong>strictly prohibited</strong> by SparkPost. This includes (and is not limited to) files with `bat` and `exe` extensions.</Banner>

#### Inline Image Object

Insert inline images into your HTML using `<img src="cid:NAME" />`, where `NAME` is the value you set in the `name` attribute.

* Lone `LF`s and lone `CR`s are allowed. SparkPost converts line endings to `CRLF` where necessary.
* It should NOT be dot stuffed. SparkPost dot stuffs before sending the email.
* It should NOT contain the SMTP terminator `\r\n.\r\n`. SparkPost adds this terminator.
The provided `email_rfc822` in MIME format will be rejected if SparkPost cannot parse the contents into a MIME tree.

Content headers are not generated for transmissions providing RFC822 content. They are expected to be provided as headers contained in the RFC822 content.

## Scheduled Transmissions [/transmissions]

<Banner status="info">Not available in SparkPost EU.</Banner>

### Schedule a Transmission [POST /transmissions/]

Create a scheduled transmission to be generated and sent at a future time by specifying `start_time` in the `options` attribute.

#### Templates in Scheduled Transmissions
Transmissions scheduled with a template will use the version of the template available at the scheduled time of generation.
This means updates to the template made between scheduling the transmission and time of generation will be reflected in the transmission.
Once message generation has been initiated, all emails in the transmission will be generated using the template version available at the start of the generation.
If a template update is made during the generation of a transmission that uses that template,
the template update will succeed, but the transmission will continue to use the version that was available at the start of the generation.
