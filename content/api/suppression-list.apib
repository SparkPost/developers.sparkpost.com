description: Manage your suppression list - a list of recipient email addresses to which you do NOT want to send email.

# Group Suppression List

A suppression list, also known as an exclusion list, stores a recipient's opt-out preferences.
It is a list of recipient email addresses to which you do NOT want to send email.
Each entry indicates whether the recipient opted out of receiving one of the following:

* Transactional messages - single recipient messages that are used operationally, e.g. to reset a password or confirm a purchase.
* Non-transactional messages - used to run email campaigns where a list of recipients are targeted, e.g. advertising a sales event.


<Banner status="success">When setting up your SparkPost account, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you import any suppression list you have from any previous service to avoid incorrectly sending mail to unsubscribed/invalid recipients.</Banner>

## Recipient Maintenance

It's good practice to maintain your recipient lists by removing recipients based on the bounce, unsubscribe, and spam complaint events provided by SparkPost.
These events are available from [webhooks](/api/webhooks/) and [message events](/api/message-events/).

SparkPost supports bulk importing or manually adding up to 1,000,000 suppression list entries total.

## Subaccount Suppressions

Each subaccount has it's own independent suppression list.
Set the `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` header to a subaccount ID to search and operate on that subaccount's suppression list.
By default, the search endpoint will search across the master account's and all subaccounts' lists.

### Retrieve a Suppression [GET /v1/suppression-list/{recipient}]

Return all suppression entries for a recipient. If the recipient is not in the suppression list, an HTTP status of 404 is returned.

##### Searching with Subaccounts
If your account has subaccounts, please provide the `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` header when performing a lookup on a specific suppression list.
- Use a value of 0 to only search against the master account suppression list.
- Use the subaccount's ID to perform a lookup on a specific subaccount suppression list.

If the `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` header is not provided, a search will be performed across the master account and all subaccount suppression lists.
Searches across multiple lists can return out of date results, with a delay of up to 20 minutes.
Searches against a specific list are not affected by this delay and return up-to-date information.
If you don't have subaccounts, you do not need to provide the `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` header in order to receive up-to-date results.

    + recipient: `rcpt@example.com` (string, required) - Recipient email address.
    + types: `transactional` (list, optional) - Types of suppressions to match in the search, i.e. entries that are `transactional` or `non_transactional`.
    + cursor (string, optional) - The results cursor location to return, to start paging with cursor, use the value of 'initial'. When cursor is provided the `page` parameter is ignored.
    + per_page (number, optional) - Maximum number of results to return per page. Must be between 1 and 10,000.
        + Default: 1000
    + page (number, optional) - The results page number to return. Used with `per_page` for paging through results. Works up to 10,000 results. Use the `cursor` parameter to page larger result sets.
