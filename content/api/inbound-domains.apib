description: Manage inbound domains, which enable you to receive emails.

# Group Inbound Domains

Inbound Domains allow you to receive emails using SparkPost. When combined with [Relay Webhooks](/api/relay-webhooks/), you can have SparkPost receive the emails sent to the inbound domain, and post the contents to your server.

## Configuring your MX records

Before you can use your inbound domain (e.g. `inbounddomain.test.com`),
you will need to add MX records to your DNS settings. The DNS settings required
depend on whether you are a SparkPost, SparkPost EU, or SparkPost Enterprise customer.

The following DNS settings are for SparkPost:

| Name                     | Type | Data                  | Priority |
|--------------------------|------|-----------------------|----------|
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | rx1.sparkpostmail.com | 10       |
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | rx2.sparkpostmail.com | 10       |
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | rx3.sparkpostmail.com | 10       |

The following DNS settings are for SparkPost EU:

| Name                     | Type | Data                     | Priority |
|--------------------------|------|--------------------------|----------|
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | rx1.eu.sparkpostmail.com | 10       |
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | rx2.eu.sparkpostmail.com | 10       |
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | rx3.eu.sparkpostmail.com | 10       |

<Banner status="info"><strong><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/enterprise-email/">SparkPost Enterprise</a> customers</strong>, you will need to use MX records similar to your existing domains. In many cases
the MX records for existing domains point at <code><tenant&gt;.mx.e.sparkpost.com.</code>.
The following DNS settings assume that your existing domains point
at <code><tenant&gt;.mx.e.sparkpost.com.</code>.  Please check with your TAM
if you are unsure of the setting in your own environment.</Banner>

| Name                     | Type | Data                           | Priority |
|--------------------------|------|--------------------------------|----------|
| `inbounddomain.test.com` | MX   | `<tenant>.mx.e.sparkpost.com`  | 10       |
