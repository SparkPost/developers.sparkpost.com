description: Query real-time data about message processing, message disposition, and campaign performance.

# Group Metrics

SparkPost logs copious amounts of statistical, real-time data about message processing, message disposition, and campaign performance. This reporting data is available in the [app](https://app.sparkpost.com/reports/summary) ([EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/reports/summary)) or through the Metrics API. The Metrics API provides a variety of endpoints enabling you to retrieve a summary of the data, data grouped by a specific qualifier, or data by event type. Within each endpoint, you can also apply various filters to drill down to the data for your specific reporting needs.

## Data retention

Metrics API data is retained for 6 months.

<Banner status="info">For a given request, average first attempt delivery latency can be calculated as <code>total_delivery_time_first / count_delivered</code>. A similar calculation holds for <code>total_delivery_time_subsequent</code>.</Banner>

## Precision Parameter

When the `precision` parameter is specified for aggregate metric requests, the bounds of the time window (`from`, `to`) are rounded to the nearest time matching the precision.
For example, requesting data between `4:22` to `6:37` would return results within the following time windows:

| Precision | Rounded time window     | Max time window |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `1min`    | `04:22:00` - `06:36:59` | `24 hours`      |
| `5min`    | `04:20:00` - `06:39:59` | `24 hours`      |
| `15min`   | `04:15:00` - `06:44:59` | `48 hours`      |
| `hour`    | `04:00:00` - `06:59:59` | `31 days`       |
| `day`     | `00:00:00` - `23:59:59` | `No max`        |

**Time-series Metrics**

When the `precision` parameter is specified for the [time-series request](#metrics-get-time-series-metrics), it reflects the period of time the data is grouped by.
The same max time window ranges apply for time-series requests as do aggregate requests. Precisions `12hr`, `week`, and `month` may also be used for time-series requests.

## Filters

Metric data can be filtered by using query parameters in the [query component](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4) of the request URI. 
Each Metrics endpoint specifies certain filters that can be set as query parameters.
The exact filters and query parameters available to each route are listed in the respective route's "parameters" section below.
The filters can be specified using either a simple or advanced query syntax.

### Simple Filters

Simple query filters can be specified as key-value pairs in the request URI and multiple values can be listed with a delimiter separating them.
For example metrics can be limited to sending domains equal to "sparkpost.com" or "example.org" with the following query string:
`?sending_domains=sparkpost.com,example.org`

### Advanced Filters

The Metrics API allows for more advanced data filtering with multiple conditions, groupings, and comparators via the `query_filters` query parameter.

The value of the `query_filters` query parameter must be structured as a URL-encoded JSON object.
The Metrics API uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to define and validate advanced filters. 
Advanced Filter requests that do not adhere to the schema will result in a `400` error response. 
Specific schema violations will be attached to the `validationErrors` property of the error response.
The exact schema can be retrieved through the `/deliverability/query-filters-schema` endpoint. 
See [Advanced Query JSON Schema](#metrics-get-advanced-query-json-schema).

Please note, advanced filters cannot be used in conjunction with simple filters. Simple filters will be ignored if the `query_filters` parameter is used. 
e.g. in `?domains=mailing.com&query_filters={}`, the domains query parameter will be ignored. 
Other query parameters like `from`, `to`, `metrics`, `limit`, etc., will be processed as expected.

#### Groupings Structure 
The JSON object consists of a root level "groupings" array containing compare objects. Multiple compare groups are evaluated such that the relationship between them is an AND operation.

Example:
````json
{
  "groupings": [
    {
       ... compare group 
    },
    {
       ... compare group 
    }
  ]
}

````

**Compare Group**

The compare objects have a single logical comparison operator (`OR` or `AND`) that will be used to compare all of the filter conditions in the group.

Example:
````json
{
      "AND":{
        "domains":{
          "eq":[
            "gmail.com",
            "yahoo.com",
            "hotmail.com"
          ],
          "like":[
            "mail"
          ]
        },
        "sending_domains":{
          "notEq": [ 
            "sparkpost.com" 
          ],
          "notLike": [
            ".io"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
````

Each filter group is comprised of the filter keys and comparator keywords.
Filter keys must be unique within a grouping, but the same filter key can appear in multiple groupings.

**Filter Keys:**   
               
               domains
               bindings
               sending_ips
               binding_groups
               ip_pools
               campaigns
               subject_campaigns
               templates
               sending_domains
               mailbox_provider
               subaccounts
               
Note: `bindings` and `binding_groups` are reserved for <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/enterprise-email/"><span class="label label-warning">Enterprise</span></a> only

**Comparator Keywords:** 

               eq       - array of exact values to match
               like     - array of substrings to match on; values must be at least 3 characters long
               notEq    - array of exact values to NOT match
               notLike  - array of substrings to NOT match on; values must be at least 3 characters long


**Put it all together:**

```json
{
  "groupings":[
    {
      "AND":{
        "domains":{

          ],
          "like":[
            "mail"
          ]
        },
        "sending_domains":{
          "notEq":[
            "sparkpost.com"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "OR":{
        "templates":{
          "eq":[
            "default"
          ]
        },
        "campaigns":{
          "like":[
            "333",
            "344",
            "355"
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "OR":{
        "campaigns":{
          "notLike":[
            "Friday"
          ],
          "notEq":[
            "stuff",
            "things"
          ]
        }
      }

## Aggregations [/v1/metrics/deliverability]

The aggregations endpoints allow you to get high-level summaries of your data grouped by specific quantifiers such as sending domain or template. You can also get specific types of data, such as rejection reason, to better understand your sending.

Use the `subaccount` field to get metrics about individual subaccounts or set it to 0 to get only the primary account's data.

### Metrics Summary [GET /v1/metrics/deliverability{?from,to,delimiter,domains,campaigns,templates,sending_ips,ip_pools,sending_domains,subaccounts,precision,metrics,timezone}]

Provides high-level summary of aggregate metrics and lists the child endpoints that contain
aggregate data, which can be used as "group by" qualifiers.
