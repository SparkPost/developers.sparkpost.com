# SparkPost API

Welcome to the SparkPost API Reference. If you're new to SparkPost, [create an account](https://app.sparkpost.com/join) ([EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/join))
and follow [this guide](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-sparkpost/) to get started.

## Endpoints

All calls to the API need to start with the appropriate base URL:

|                   |                        |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **SparkPost**     |`https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1`   |
| **[SparkPost EU](#header-sparkpost-eu)** | `https://api.eu.sparkpost.com/api/v1` |

For Enterprise accounts with their own endpoint, please contact your account manager for more information.

## Authentication

Authenticate each request by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization" target="_blank">
Authorization header</a> with a valid API key. Create and manage your API Keys in the [app](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/api-keys) ([EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/account/api-keys)).

We accept just the API key:
```
"Authorization": "14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf"
```
or Basic type and the API key:
```
"Authorization": "Basic 14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf"
```

Make sure to store your API keys somewhere secure and never share them publicly.

## API Examples

### cURL
If you are using cURL to call the API, you must include the resource URI in quotes when you pass in multiple query parameters separated by an `&`.

For example:

```
curl -v \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: 14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf" \
-X GET "https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/metrics/deliverability/aggregate?campaigns=testjob&from=2017-01-23T14:00&metrics=count_targeted,count_sent,count_accepted&timezone=America%2FNew_York&to=2017-06-23T15:50"
```

Using the `-u` flag for authentication:

```
curl -v \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-u 14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf: \
-X GET "https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/metrics/deliverability/aggregate?campaigns=testjob&from=2017-01-23T14:00&metrics=count_targeted,count_sent,count_accepted&timezone=America%2FNew_York&to=2017-06-23T15:50"
```

### Postman

If you use <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> you can click the following button to import the SparkPost API as a collection:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/ee44dcd644445e8bd864)

**Environment Setup**

Our collection is set up to expect two Postman variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| API_KEY  | Used to [authenticate](#header-authentication) requests. Set it to a valid API Key  |
| BASE_URL | [API Hostname](#header-endpoints) to be used.                                       |

More information on setting up Postman environments and variables can be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables).

### Client Libraries
SparkPost has several official and community supported client libraries. Check out our [Developer Hub](https://developers.sparkpost.com) or our [GitHub](https://github.com/sparkpost) for examples in your favorite language.

## API Conventions
* Trailing slashes are ignored: /transmissions is equivalent to /transmissions/.
* URL paths, URL query parameter names, and JSON field names are case sensitive.
* URL paths use lower case, with dashes separating words.
* Query parameters and JSON fields use lower case, with underscores separating words.
* The HTTP status indicates whether an operation failed or succeeded, with extra information included in the HTTP response body.
* All APIs return standard HTTP error code formats. See [Errors](#header-errors).
* Unexpected query parameters and request body fields are ignored.
* Our JSON number type is bounded to a signed 32-bit integer.

## SparkPost EU

SparkPost EU is the full SparkPost service hosted in Western Europe. [SparkPost](https://app.sparkpost.com/)
and [SparkPost EU](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/) accounts operate independently.
An account created in SparkPost cannot be used in SparkPost EU, and vice-versa.
You can create accounts in both regions. All documentation here works for both services.
When relevant, EU specific links and information will be provided alongside general information.

## Feature Availability
SparkPost presents a unified core API to all users with a few noted exceptions.
This documentation is meant to serve as reference for all accounts, from Developer to Enterprise.
Features that are limited to some accounts will be marked appropriately throughout as:
* **Not available on Enterprise**
* **Enterprise only**

## Rate Limiting
SparkPost APIs are rate limited, which limits how often each user can call the API, in order to protect the service from inadvertent or malicious overuse. If you exceed the limits for an API you will receive an HTTP status code 429. These limits are dynamic, but as a general rule, wait 1 to 5 seconds after receiving a 429 response before requesting again. Heavier usage patterns may require a more sophisticated and incremental backoff strategy.

The Transmissions API is not rate-limited in this way, however some customers may have daily or monthly [sending limits](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/transmissions/#header-sending-limits) which may trigger a 420.

### Alternatives To Polling
For some common use cases, the API offers more efficient alternatives to polling, especially of the Events endpoint. For example, a single call to the [metrics deliverability summary](/api/metrics/#metrics-get-metrics-summary)
endpoint offers a summary of deliveries, bounces, opens, clicks, and more for some time period.
If your application requires low latency access to each event, using a [webhook-based](/api/webhooks/)
process will be more efficient than polling message events and avoids rate limiting.

**Sandbox Domain Limits:** The sandbox sending domain (`sparkpostbox.com`) is limited to 5 emails for the lifetime of your account.

## Account Suspension

If your account has been suspended due to concern about a possible violation of our [Messaging Policy](https://www.sparkpost.com/policies), please reply to the email you should have received from compliance@sparkpost.com.

If you have not received this email, you can still contact the Compliance team directly [through the app](https://app.sparkpost.com/?supportTicket=true&issueId=account_suspension) [[EU]](https://app.eu.sparkpost.com/?supportTicket=true&issueId=account_suspension).

## Errors

When you make an API call you may receive an error message in response. Either there is something wrong with your request or something went wrong on our end. Errors respond with an error code and JSON that contains a more precise message, description and API code.
### Example Error
```
422 Unprocessable Entity
```
```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "required field is missing",
      "description": "content object or template_id required",
      "code": "1400"
    }
  ]
}
```

| 401  | Unauthorized           | You don't have the needed authorization to make the request.                   | Make sure you are using a valid API key with the necessary permissions for your request.                                                             |
| 403  | Forbidden              | The server understood the request but refused to fulfill it.                   | See if your SparkPost plan includes the resource you are requesting and your API key has the necessary premissions.                                  |

| 409  | Conflict               | A conflict arose from your request. (e.g. user already exists with that email) | Modify the payload to clear the conflict.                                                                                                            |
| 415  | Unsupported Media Type | The request is not in a supported format.                                      | Check that your Content-Type header is a supported type and that your request adheres to the documentation.                                          |
| 422  | Unprocessable Entity   | The request was syntactically correct but failed due to semantic errors.       | Make sure that your request includes all of the required fields and your data is valid.                                                              |

| 500  | Internal Server Error  | Something went wrong on our end.                                               | Try the request again later. If the error does not resolve, check [our status page](https://status.sparkpost.com/) for service updates.
