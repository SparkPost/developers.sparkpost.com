description: Manage relay webhooks, a way to instruct SparkPost to accept inbound email on your behalf and forward it to you over HTTP.

# Group Relay Webhooks

Relay Webhooks are a way to instruct SparkPost to forward messages sent to an inbound domain to a target url for your own consumption. Before you create a relay webhook, first create and configure an [inbound domain](/api/inbound-domains/). The Relay Webhooks API provides the means to create, list, retrieve, update, and delete a relay webhook.

## Relay Webhook Object

+ Data Structure: Attributes
    + id (string) - Unique ID
    + name (string) - Relay webhook name
    + target (string) - URL of the target to which to POST relay batches
    + auth_token (string) - Authentication token to present in the `X-MessageSystems-Webhook-Token` header of POST requests to target. Use this token in your target application to confirm that data is coming from SparkPost.
    + match: SMTP (object) - Restrict which inbound messages will be relayed to the target.
        + protocol: SMTP (string) - Inbound messaging protocol associated with this webhook.
        + domain (string) - Inbound domain associated with this webhook.
    + custom_headers (object) - Object of custom HTTP headers to be used during POST requests to target.
+ Sample

    ```
    {
        "id": "12013026328707075",
        "name": "Inbound Customer Replies",
        "target": "https://webhooks.customer.example/replies",
        "auth_token": "5ebe2294ecd0e0f08eab7690d2a6ee69",
        "match": {
            "protocol": "SMTP",
            "domain": "example.com"
        }
    }
    ```
        
### Custom HTTP Headers Properties

The custom headers JSON object allows you to add up to five custom headers to your relay webhook. The `custom_headers` object may only be up to 3,000 bytes in size, and must be formatted as an object with keys as strings or numbers. Headers already used by SparkPost will not be allowed, and SparkPost may also disallow some HTTP headers for security reasons.

**Adding Custom Headers**

When creating (POST) or updating (PUT) a Relay Webhook:

```json
{
  "custom_headers": {
    "header1": "value1",
    "header2": "value2"
  }
}
```

**Removing Custom Headers**

When updating (PUT) a Relay Webhook:

```json
{
  "custom_headers": {}
}
```

## Relay Webhook Payload

The following fields will be included in each object posted to the relay webhook's target:

+ Data Structure: relay_message
    + content (object) - The content parsed from the incoming message.
        + html (string) - Contents of the first text/html part of the message.
        + text (string) - Contents of the first text/plain part of the message.
        + subject (string) - "Subject" header value (decoded from email).
        + to (array[string]) - "To" header value (decoded from email), RFC2822 address list.
        + cc (array[string]) - "CC" header value (decoded from email), RFC2822 address list.
        + headers (array[object]) - Ordered array of email top-level headers. This array preserves ordering and allows for multiple occurrences of a header (e.g. to support trace headers such as "Received").
        + email_rfc822 (string)
            Raw MIME content for an email. If the Raw MIME content contains at least one non UTF-8 encoded character, the entire `email_rfc822` value will be base64 encoded and `email_rfc822_is_base64` will be set to true.
        + email_rfc822_is_base64 (boolean)
            Whether the `email_rfc822` value is base64 encoded.
    + friendly_from (string) 
        Email address used to compose the "From" header
    + msg_from (string)
        [SMTP envelope](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc5321_line817) "MAIL FROM", matches "Return-Path" header address
    + rcpt_to (string) 
        [SMTP envelope](http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc5321_line817) "RCPT TO"
    + webhook_id (string) - ID of the relay webhook which triggered this relay message.
    + protocol: smtp (string) - Protocol of the originating inbound message.
    + customer_id (string) - Customer ID of the customer that created the relay webhook.
