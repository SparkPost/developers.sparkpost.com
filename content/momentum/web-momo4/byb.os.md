## 6.2. Operating System

Momentum 4 supports the latest version of the following operating systems:

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (x86_64)

*   CentOS 6

Ensure that you have the correct operating system packages installed. Prepare as many machines as you plan to use for Momentum 4\. An optimum installation uses an odd number of three or more Analytics *and* three or more Platform nodes. **Note:** Do not mix operating systems.
