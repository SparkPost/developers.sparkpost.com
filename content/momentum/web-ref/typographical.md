## 1. Typographical Conventions Used in This Document

Certain typographical conventions are used in this document. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following examples.

*   **Text in this style**               indicates executable programs such as **ecelerity**.

*   `Text in this style` is used when referring to file names. For example, "The `ecelerity.conf` file is used to configure Momentum."

*   `Text in this style` is used when referring to command options. For example, "`list` is an option for the **module** command."

*   *Text in this style*               is used for emphasis.

*   **Text in this style**               is used for added emphasis.

*   *`Text in this style`*                indicates variable input—text that changes depending upon circumstances. For example, "For *`passwd`* enter the password you created during installation."

*   **`Text in this style`**                indicates user input. For example, "Install the application by issuing the command **`./installer`**."

*   `Text in this style` is used for literal values and variable names. For example, "A license file named `license`."

*   Text such as the following, ‘`C`’, is used to indicate a literal reference to a specific character. For example, "The letter ‘`C`’ in CIDR stands for 'Classless'".

In some circumstances, what appears on one line on the screen or in a program listing cannot be represented on one line in some forms of the documentation. In circumstances such as this, the ‘`»`’ character is used. For example:

```
1187990817@DD/0C-13258-881AAC64@T@gmal.com@0@foogroup@foo1@21@8@ »
306072.00@10.0.0.1@421 4.4.0 [internal] no adequate servers
```

The preceding line would appear unbroken in a log file but, if left as is, it would be truncated in a PDF version of the documentation.

Where possible, Unix command-line commands are broken using the ‘`\`’ character, making it possible to copy and paste commands. For example:

/opt/msys/ecelerity/bin/ec_md5passwd -r "Ecelerity Command Center" \
  -f /opt/msys/ecelerity/etc/console_passwd *`ecadmin`* *`testing`*
