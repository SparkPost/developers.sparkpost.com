        Snapchat, Messenger, FaceTime, and Kik are all great, but email is still the king of communication. Email is universal, has zero barriers to adoption, and it’s an open standard, no matter your users’ platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s automated emails to verify a password, personalized messages to your user list, or a sophisticated triggered onboarding program, SparkPost provides the tools necessary to track your users’ reactions and to keep them engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a just few ways you can use SparkPost in your app:
      </p>
      <h2>Transactional Emails</h2>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Password Recovery</strong> - Developers can use SparkPost APIs to send password recovery emails to unique users.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification and Reminders</strong> - Developers can use SparkPost to send out real-time, personalized notifications and reminders to users based on their preferences (e.g., price alerts, upgrade noti cations and task reminders).</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Inbound Relay</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto-Replies</strong> - Trigger an email response to the sender.</li>
        <li><strong>Raffle</strong> - Use email to collect entries for a giveaway and select a winner at random.</li>
        <li><strong>Voting System</strong> - Tally and track votes by allowing participants to cast vote via email.</li>
        <li><strong>Proxying</strong> (i.e. Support Systems, CRMs, etc.) - Create new support tickets, contacts, etc in a third party system by processing an email.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Blind Messaging</strong> (i.e. Match.com, Craigslist) - Use the SparkPost Inbound Relay to set up anonymous messaging.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data and Analytics</h2>
